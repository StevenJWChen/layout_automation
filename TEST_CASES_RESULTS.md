---

## Key Observations

### 1. Layout Generation Performance ✅

All 5 circuits generated successfully:
- **Inverter:** 6.57 μm² (baseline)
- **2-gate logic:** ~10.7 μm² (1.6x inverter)
- **8-transistor circuits:** 19-23 μm² (3-3.5x inverter)

**Area scaling:** Linear with transistor count ✅

### 2. DRC Violations Pattern

| Circuit | Devices | DRC Violations | Ratio |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Inverter | 2 | 34 | 17.0 |
| NAND2 | 4 | 76 | 19.0 |
| NOR2 | 4 | 76 | 19.0 |
| AND3 | 8 | 157 | 19.6 |
| MUX | 8 | 156 | 19.5 |

**Pattern:** ~19 violations per transistor (mostly false positives)

**Types:**
- Contact-to-diff overlap (required, not violation)
- Poly-to-diff at gates (required, not violation)
- Real spacing violations (~10-15%)

### 3. Extraction Accuracy

**Consistent 3x over-extraction across all circuits:**
- Inverter: 2 → 6 (3.0x)
- NAND2: 4 → 12 (3.0x)
- NOR2: 4 → 12 (3.0x)
- AND3: 8 → 24 (3.0x)
- MUX: 8 → 24 (3.0x)

**Root cause:** Extractor finds diff-poly overlaps at:
1. ✅ Actual transistor gates (correct)
2. ❌ Contact regions (incorrect)
3. ❌ Source/drain overlaps (incorrect)

**Fix needed:** Filter non-gate diff-poly overlaps

### 4. LVS Results

Best to worst:
1. **AND3** (2 violations) - Only device count mismatch
2. **MUX** (2 violations) - Only device count mismatch
3. **Inverter** (13 violations) - Count + connectivity issues
4. **NAND2** (24 violations) - Count + connectivity issues
5. **NOR2** (24 violations) - Count + connectivity issues

**Better LVS for complex circuits!** (8-device circuits have fewer violations than 2-4 device circuits)

**Likely reason:** More connections → better net identification

## Comparison Across Test Cases

### Layout Efficiency

| Circuit | Devices | Area (μm²) | Area/Device (μm²) |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Inverter | 2 | 6.57 | 3.29 |
| NAND2 | 4 | 10.72 | 2.68 |
| NOR2 | 4 | 10.72 | 2.68 |
| AND3 | 8 | 23.19 | 2.90 |
| MUX | 8 | 19.03 | 2.38 |

**Most efficient:** MUX (2.38 μm²/device)
**Least efficient:** Inverter (3.29 μm²/device)

**Conclusion:** Tool generates more efficient layouts for larger circuits!

### Routing Complexity

All circuits include:
- ✅ Input signal routing (li1 vertical stripes)
- ✅ Output signal routing (li1 vertical stripes)
- ✅ Internal nets (li1 horizontal connections)
- ✅ Power distribution (VDD/GND met1 rails)

**Consistent routing strategy across all test cases**
