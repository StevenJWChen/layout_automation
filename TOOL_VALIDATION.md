## Tool Capabilities

### What the Tool DOES
1. ✅ **Constraint-based layout**: Define spatial relationships, solver finds positions
2. ✅ **Hierarchical design**: Build complex layouts from reusable cells
3. ✅ **Automatic positioning**: No need to manually calculate coordinates
4. ✅ **GDS export**: Generate industry-standard layout files
5. ✅ **Visualization**: See your layout before fabrication
6. ✅ **SciPy-based**: Uses standard scientific Python (no Z3 dependency)

### What the Tool DOES NOT Do
1. ❌ **Design rule checking (DRC)**: Does not validate electrical/physical correctness
2. ❌ **Layout vs. schematic (LVS)**: Does not verify connectivity
3. ❌ **Automatic routing**: No automated wire routing
4. ❌ **Parasitic extraction**: No RC calculations
5. ❌ **Timing analysis**: No delay calculations
6. ❌ **Device modeling**: No transistor physics

## Usage Model

### Correct Usage Pattern

```python
from gds_cell import Cell, Polygon, CellInstance

# 1. Create base cell with polygons
base = Cell('base')
rect1 = Polygon('rect1', 'metal1')
rect2 = Polygon('rect2', 'poly')
base.add_polygon([rect1, rect2])

# 2. Define constraints (spatial relationships)
base.constrain(rect1, 'sx2+5<ox1', rect2)  # rect2 right of rect1

# 3. Create top cell with instances
top = Cell('top')
inst1 = CellInstance('inst1', base)
inst2 = CellInstance('inst2', base)
top.add_instance([inst1, inst2])

# 4. Constrain instances
top.constrain(inst1, 'sx2+10<ox1', inst2)

# 5. Solve and visualize
if top.solver():
    top.draw()
    top.export_gds('output.gds')
```

### Key Principles

1. **Build bottom-up**: Create leaf cells first, then compose
2. **Use relative constraints**: Define relationships, not absolute positions
3. **Verify incrementally**: Test each level of hierarchy
4. **Check results**: Always validate that output makes sense
5. **Understand constraints**: Know what you're asking the solver to do

## Critical Lessons from Inverter Attempt

### What Went Wrong
- ❌ Constraints specified incorrectly
- ❌ No domain knowledge validation
- ❌ Released without verification
- ❌ Tool found *a* solution, not *the right* solution

### What We Learned
1. **Tool works correctly** - It solved the constraints as specified
2. **User responsibility** - Must provide correct constraints
3. **Verification essential** - Always check results visually and numerically
4. **Domain knowledge required** - Can't substitute solver for understanding

## Recommendations for Users

### Before You Start
1. **Understand your design**: Know the physical structure you want
2. **Study examples**: Look at real layouts in your domain
3. **Start simple**: Build one layer at a time
4. **Validate early**: Check each step before proceeding

### While Designing
1. **Use descriptive names**: Makes debugging easier
2. **Add constraints incrementally**: Test after each addition
3. **Check solver output**: If it fails, constraints may be inconsistent
4. **Visualize often**: Draw frequently to catch errors

### After Solving
1. **Verify positions**: Print polygon coordinates
2. **Check relationships**: Verify constraints are actually satisfied
3. **Visual inspection**: Look at the PNG output carefully
4. **Layer overlap check**: Ensure layers interact correctly
5. **GDS viewer**: Use professional tool to verify export

## Limitations and Requirements

### Current Limitations
1. **No DRC**: Users must manually verify design rules
2. **No LVS**: Users must manually verify electrical connectivity
3. **Linear constraints only**: Non-linear relationships not supported
4. **Local optimization**: May find local optima, not global
5. **Manual validation**: No automatic correctness checking

### User Requirements
- **Domain knowledge**: Understand IC layout or target domain
- **Constraint skills**: Ability to formulate spatial relationships
- **Validation discipline**: Check results before using them
- **Debugging skills**: Trace issues when solver fails

## Tool Status

### Core Functionality: ✅ READY
- Hierarchical cells: ✅ Working
- Constraint solving: ✅ Working
- Coordinate transformation: ✅ Working
- GDS export: ✅ Working
- Visualization: ✅ Working

### Validation: ⚠️ USER RESPONSIBILITY
- Design rule checking: ❌ Not provided
- Electrical correctness: ❌ Not provided
- Physical validity: ❌ Not provided
- Users must validate their own designs!

## Conclusion

**The tool is ready for use by knowledgeable users who:**
- Understand their target domain (IC design, PCB, etc.)
- Can formulate correct constraints
- Will validate their results
- Accept responsibility for correctness

**The tool is NOT ready for:**
- Automated design without human oversight
- Users without domain knowledge
- Production use without additional validation layers
- Use as a black box without understanding

## Final Recommendation

✅ **Use the tool** for constraint-based layout automation
✅ **Validate your results** thoroughly before fabrication
✅ **Build incrementally** and test at each step
✅ **Learn from examples** but verify them first

⚠️ **Remember**: The solver finds solutions to constraints, not correct designs. You must provide correct constraints and validate results!
