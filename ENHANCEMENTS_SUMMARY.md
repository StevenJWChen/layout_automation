# Layout Automation Tool - Enhancement Summary

## Overview

Based on comprehensive research into professional EDA tools and academic constraint-based layout systems, I've added four major enhancement categories that bring your tool up to industry standards.

## What Was Added

### 1. Design Rule Checking (DRC) - `drc.py`

**Why it matters**: Professional EDA tools (Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsys) all include DRC as a fundamental feature. Without it, users can create layouts that violate fabrication requirements.

**Features**:
- **Spacing rules**: Minimum distance between polygons on same/different layers
- **Width rules**: Minimum width for features
- **Area rules**: Minimum area requirements
- **Overlap rules**: Required overlap between layers
- **Enclosure rules**: Outer layer must enclose inner layer by minimum amount

**Usage**:
```python
from drc import DRCChecker, create_default_rules

rules = create_default_rules()  # Or create custom rules
checker = DRCChecker(rules)
violations = checker.check_cell(my_cell)
checker.print_violations()
```

**Research basis**: All professional EDA tools include DRC. This is table stakes for IC design.

### 2. Symmetry Constraints - Enhanced `gds_cell.py`

**Why it matters**: MAGICAL research paper identified symmetry as "the most essential and widely adopted constraint" in analog IC layout. Differential pairs, current mirrors, and many analog circuits require perfect symmetry.

**Features**:
- Vertical symmetry (mirror left-right)
- Horizontal symmetry (mirror top-bottom)
- Fixed or floating axis positioning
- Automatic constraint generation (same size, aligned, mirrored positions)

**Usage**:
```python
# Create symmetric pair (like differential pair)
cell.add_symmetry(inst1, inst2, axis='y')  # Vertical axis

# With fixed axis position
cell.add_symmetry(inst1, inst2, axis='y', axis_position=100.0)
```

**Research basis**:
- MAGICAL paper emphasizes symmetry constraints
- Cadence Virtuoso has built-in symmetry tools
- Critical for analog/mixed-signal design

---

### 3. Constraint Debugging - `constraint_debug.py`

**Why it matters**: When constraints fail, users need to understand why. Google OR-Tools and other professional constraint solvers provide detailed diagnostics.

**Features**:
- Check which constraints are satisfied/violated after solving
- Visualize constraints overlaid on layout
- Diagnose infeasible constraint systems
- Identify over-constrained objects
- Generate detailed reports

**Usage**:
```python
from constraint_debug import ConstraintDebugger

debugger = ConstraintDebugger(cell)
debugger.check_constraints()
debugger.print_constraint_status()
debugger.visualize_constraints()  # Show constraints on layout
diagnostics = debugger.diagnose_infeasible()
```

**Research basis**:
- Professional constraint solvers provide failure diagnostics
- Essential for debugging complex constraint systems
- Visualization helps users understand spatial relationships

---

### 4. Array Generators - `array_gen.py`

**Why it matters**: Memory arrays, register files, and many digital/analog structures use regular patterns. Manually creating constraints for 100+ instances is tedious and error-prone.

**Features**:
- 1D arrays (horizontal rows, vertical columns)
- 2D grids with automatic constraint generation
- Symmetric pairs
- Interleaved arrays (alternating cell types)
- Ring arrangements
- Convenience functions for common patterns

**Usage**:
```python
from array_gen import create_row, create_grid, ArrayGenerator

# Quick row creation
instances = create_row(cell, unit_cell, count=8, spacing=10.0)

# 2D grid
grid = create_grid(cell, unit_cell, rows=4, cols=6,
                   spacing_x=12.0, spacing_y=10.0)

# Advanced patterns
gen = ArrayGenerator()
inst1, inst2 = gen.create_symmetric_pair(cell, unit_cell, axis='y')
instances = gen.create_ring_array(cell, unit_cell, count=12, radius=50.0)
```

**Research basis**:
- Standard feature in all EDA tools
- MAGICAL includes parametric generators
- Essential for real-world designs
