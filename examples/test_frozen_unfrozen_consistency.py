"""
Test to verify that solving a layout with a frozen instance and then
unfreezing and re-solving yields the same result.

Test scenario (as requested by user):
1. Create a hierarchical cell
2. Copy it to create another cell instance
3. Freeze ONE of the copies
4. Place both (frozen and unfrozen) in a parent cell at specific locations
5. Solve the parent cell
6. Save all positions ("before")
7. Unfreeze the frozen copy
8. Solve again
9. Save all positions ("after")
10. Verify that "before" and "after" are EXACTLY the same

This ensures that freezing is purely an optimization and doesn't change
the solved layout.
