### 4. Fix vs Freeze Comparison (test_fix_vs_freeze.py)

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | freeze_layout | fix_layout |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Internal structure | Hidden (black box) | Visible and accessible |
| Repositioning | Size fixed, position can vary | Position and internals update together |
| Internal polygons | Don't update when moved | **Automatically update** |
| Solver optimization | ✓ Yes (reduces constraints) | ✓ Yes (similar to freeze) |
| Use case | Standard cell libraries | Reusable, repositionable blocks |

## Performance Analysis

### Why fix_layout is So Fast

**Original Approach:**
```python
# Create 25 unique cells for 5x5 array
for i in range(25):
    cell = create_unique_cell()
    parent.add_instance(cell)
    parent.constrain(cell, ...)
parent.solver()  # Solves 25 cells + hierarchy
# Time: 1.4539s
```

**Fix Layout Approach:**
```python
# Create 1 template, fix, copy 25 times
template = create_cell()
template.solver()
template.fix_layout()

for i in range(25):
    cell = template.copy()
    cell.set_position(x, y)  # No solver!
# Time: 0.0033s (436x faster!)
```

### Scaling Analysis

| Array Size | Cells | Original | Fix Layout | Speedup |
|------------|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| 2x2        | 4     | 0.0065s  | 0.0027s   | 2.5x    |
| 3x3        | 9     | 0.2271s  | 0.0028s   | 81x     |
| 4x4        | 16    | 1.4385s  | 0.0030s   | 478x    |
| 5x5        | 25    | 1.4539s  | 0.0033s   | 437x    |

**Pattern:** As array size increases, speedup becomes more dramatic because:
- Original: Solver complexity grows with number of cells
- Fix layout: Constant time (only template solve)

## Accuracy Verification

### Position Matching
- **Tolerance:** < 1e-9 (near floating-point precision)
- **Match Rate:** 100% across all tests
- **Verification Method:** Element-by-element comparison of 3D arrays

### Example Verification (2x2 array, cell at [1][1]):
```
Original:   [30, 30, 40, 40]  (cell)
            [30, 30, 40, 40]  (polygon 0)
            [42, 30, 47, 40]  (polygon 1)
            [30, 42, 47, 47]  (polygon 2)

Fix Layout: [30, 30, 40, 40]  (cell)
            [30, 30, 40, 40]  (polygon 0)
            [42, 30, 47, 40]  (polygon 1)
            [30, 42, 47, 47]  (polygon 2)

Difference: [0, 0, 0, 0] - EXACT MATCH
```

## Usage Example

### Manual Positioning

```python
from layout_automation.cell import Cell

# 1. Create and solve a cell
block = Cell('block')
# ... add children and constraints ...
block.solver()

# 2. Fix the layout
block.fix_layout()  # Stores relative offsets

# 3. Create copies
copy1 = block.copy('copy1')
copy2 = block.copy('copy2')
copy3 = block.copy('copy3')

# 4. Position manually - NO SOLVER NEEDED!
copy1.set_position(0, 0)      # All internals update automatically
copy2.set_position(100, 0)    # All internals update automatically
copy3.set_position(0, 100)    # All internals update automatically
```

### Constraint-Based Positioning

Fixed layout cells can also be positioned using constraints:

```python
# Create and fix a cell
template = Cell('template')
# ... add children and constraints ...
template.solver()
template.fix_layout()

# Position using constraints in parent cell
top = Cell('top')
cell1 = template.copy('cell1')
cell2 = template.copy('cell2')
top.add_instance([cell1, cell2])

# Use constraints to position fixed cells
top.constrain(cell1, 'x1=0, y1=0')           # Absolute position
top.constrain(cell2, 'sx1=ox2+10', cell1)     # Relative to cell1
top.solver()  # Solver positions cell1 and cell2 correctly

# All internal polygons update automatically!
```

## Recent Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Constraint-based positioning for fixed cells (2025-10-17)

**Issue:** Fixed cells positioned via solver constraints were not maintaining their correct positions. After the solver determined the correct position, `_update_parent_bounds()` would recalculate the fixed cell's bounds from its children's stale positions, overwriting the solver's correct result.

**Root Cause:** Fixed cells' children maintain their positions from when the cell was originally solved. When `_update_parent_bounds()` ran, it would calculate the bounding box from these stale child positions instead of using the position the solver just determined.

**Fix:** Modified `_update_parent_bounds()` to skip fixed and frozen cells. These cells have their positions determined by:
- **Frozen cells:** Solver positions the cell as a whole (black box)
- **Fixed cells:** Solver positions the cell, then `update_fixed_positions()` updates children based on offsets

**Tests Added:**
- `test_fix_layout_constraints.py` - Comprehensive constraint positioning tests including:
  - Relative positioning between fixed cells
  - Absolute positioning of fixed cells
  - Multiple fixed cells in sequence
  - Fixed cells in hierarchical structures

All existing tests continue to pass with 100% position accuracy and 2-500x performance improvement.

### Fixed: Constraint operator bug (2025-10-17)

**Issue:** Strict inequality operators `<` and `>` were being treated as non-strict (`<=` and `>=`). For example, `x1 > 10` would allow `x1 = 10`, which violates the constraint.

**Root Cause:** The operator checking used `if operator in ['<', '<=']` which would apply `<=` for both `<` and `<=`. Same issue with `>` and `>=`.

**Fix:** Changed to exact operator matching:
```python
if operator == '<':
    model.Add(left_linear_expr < right_linear_expr)
elif operator == '<=':
    model.Add(left_linear_expr <= right_linear_expr)
# ... (similar for >, >=, =)
```

**Tests Added:**
- `test_operator_correctness.py` - Tests all operators including boundary conditions
- Verifies strict vs non-strict inequalities work correctly

### Enhanced: Draw resolution (2025-10-17)

**Change:** Increased figure size from `(3, 3)` to `(10, 10)` inches with explicit `dpi=100` for much better visibility and detail in layout visualizations.
